## 🚀 What's in Store?

Here, we delve into unconventional ideas that can reshape the healthcare landscape. It's not just about reading; it's about driving change and pushing boundaries.

🌍 **Global Impact**: We're exploring how healthcare property and practice can transcend borders, creating a world where patients have diverse options and practitioners can innovate freely.

⚖️ **Eliminating Barriers**: Let's discuss how to break down the walls that limit access to healthcare facilities and create monopolies. It's time for a more inclusive and open system.

## 💡 Decentralized Healthcare Innovations

### Provision Request and Facility Authentication

In the decentralized healthcare network, the process of provisioning care is designed to be seamless and accessible, empowering both patients and physicians.

#### 📋 Provision Request by Physicians

Physicians can effortlessly record scheduled provision requests in response to patient demands. When a patient submits a request for on-premise healthcare setup, the physician takes action. To ensure the highest standards of care, physicians can verify the licensure of on-premise facilities. This verification, performed using a consistent authentication architecture, is particularly vital for certain practices such as surgery.

#### 🏥 Facility Authentication

Facilities, as indispensable components of healthcare, play a crucial role in the patient care journey. Authentication is a vital step to ensure that patients receive care at authorized locations. Facilities can also independently confirm a physician's license by connecting with licensing/credentialing agents dedicated to healthcare.

#### 🚫 No Denial of Care

One of the core principles is to prevent facilities from denying care to patients based on the preference of physicians or access issues. This approach eliminates the risk of facilities acting as institutions that can limit access to healthcare. The focus is on delivering care efficiently and ensuring that the physician's credentials are in compliance.

#### 🌐 Incentivizing Interoperability

The decentralized healthcare ecosystem thrives on collaboration and interoperability. The prospect of a diverse pool of physicians incentivizes healthcare facilities to develop interoperable systems. This lowers the capital risks associated with physicians extending their practice models to new regions. Telemedical provisions, in particular, benefit from this setup, making the hosting of provisions cost-effective and attainable.

#### 💡 Diversified Healthcare Providers

A diversified portfolio of healthcare providers benefits both patients and facilities. It creates robustness and resilience within healthcare facilities, enabling them to adapt to fluctuations in practices within a region. Patients gain access to a broader range of healthcare choices, ensuring their healthcare needs are met.

#### 🌍 Empowering Patient Choices

Patients have the power to shape their healthcare experiences. They can set up healthcare at a physician's original facility or receive telemedical care at a remote facility. As long as there is a licensed physician available to authenticate themselves within a region and host the selected model of healthcare practice, patients and their communities have the freedom to define their healthcare landscapes.
